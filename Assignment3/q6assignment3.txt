(A) part
Advantages of using OO
1.OO allows to break the entire code into parts i.e. computational units and work on each separately.
2.Easy to debug the code.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1.Takes comparitivel less time to execute.
2.Dictionaries are easy to understand and implement as compared to OO while writing a program.

Disadvantages of using OO
1.while using OO for implementing the program,the program becomes too lengthy and thus also takes more time to execute.
2.OO takes time to understand to how to execute it and get used to it.

Disadvantages of using Dictionaries
1.Difficult to implement complex problems and can't break into smaller parts.
2.Difficult to debug.
