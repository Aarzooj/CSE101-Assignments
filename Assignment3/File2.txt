Water is the most important component of life, which is needed by human beings and needed for animals, birds, trees, etc. It exists in three different forms on the earth, i.e., solid, liquid, and gas. Water exists in the form of ice and water vapour forms. 
It also exists in the form of liquid in the seas, oceans, rivers, etc., but the composition of water remains the same throughout the earth. It is an important compound that is needed by all living organisms. Plants need water for photosynthesis, and humans need water for various purposes like cooking, bathing, washing, etc. 
So, like oxygen is an essential component for survival, water is also a crucial component of life.
